# Healthcare Analytics Lab: OLTP to Star Schema

**Data Engineering Mini Project**

## Overview

You've joined HealthTech Analytics as a junior data engineer. The clinical team built a normalized transactional database (3NF), but analytics queries are slow.

Your job: analyze the OLTP schema, identify performance issues, then design and build an optimized star schema.

This mirrors real-world data engineering work.

## Part 1: Normalized OLTP Schema

The production system uses 8 normalized tables. Study the schema and understand how data is organized.

### Schema DDL

    mrn VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE specialties (
    specialty_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    specialty_name VARCHAR(100),
    specialty_code VARCHAR(10)
);

## Part 2: Find the Performance Problem

You're given 4 business questions. Write the SQL to answer each one using the normalized schema above. Run the queries, measure performance, and identify bottlenecks.

### Question 1: Monthly Encounters by Specialty

**What we need:** For each month and specialty, show total encounters and unique patients by encounter type.

**Your task:**
1. Write the SQL query
2. Document: How many tables do you join?
3. Measure: What's the query execution time?
4. Analyze: Why is this slow? (Hint: JOIN chain + GROUP BY)

### Question 2: Top Diagnosis-Procedure Pairs

**What we need:** What are the most common diagnosis-procedure combinations? Show the ICD code, procedure code, and encounter count.

**Your task:**
1. Write the SQL query
2. Document: How do you join diagnosis and procedure data across separate junction tables?
3. Measure: What's the query execution time?
4. Analyze: Why is this slow? (Hint: Two junction tables → row explosion)

### Question 3: 30-Day Readmission Rate

**What we need:** Which specialty has the highest readmission rate? (Definition: inpatient discharge, then return within 30 days)

**Your task:**
1. Write the SQL query (you'll need a self-join on encounters)
2. Document: How do you detect a readmission using discharge_date and subsequent encounters?
3. Measure: What's the query execution time?
4. Analyze: Why is this slow? (Hint: Self-joins on large tables)

### Question 4: Revenue by Specialty & Month

**What we need:** Total allowed amounts by specialty and month. Which specialties generate most revenue?

**Your task:**
1. Write the SQL query
2. Document: What's the JOIN chain? (billing → encounters → providers → specialties)
3. Measure: What's the query execution time?
4. Analyze: Why is this slow? (Hint: Multiple JOINs + aggregation)

### Part 2 Deliverable: query_analysis.txt

For each question, document:

```
QUESTION #: [Title]

SQL Query:
[Your query here]

Schema Analysis:
Tables joined: [list them]
Number of joins: [X]

Performance:

Estimated rows scanned: [Y]

Bottleneck Identified:
[Why is this slow? What's the root cause?]
```

## Part 3: Design the Star Schema

Now that you've experienced the performance pain, design an optimized dimensional model.

### 3.1: Design Decisions

Answer these design questions in a document called `design_decisions.txt`:

#### Decision 1: Fact Table Grain

Choose one:
- **Option A:** One row per encounter
- **Option B:** One row per diagnosis within an encounter
- **Option C:** One row per procedure within an encounter

Document your choice and why it's best for these 4 queries.

#### Decision 2: Dimension Tables

List which dimension tables you'll create and what attributes each should contain:
- Date dimension (what columns?)
- Patient dimension (what columns?)
- Provider dimension (what columns?)
- Specialty dimension (what columns?)
- Department dimension (what columns?)
- Encounter type dimension (what columns?)
- Others? (diagnoses? procedures?)

#### Decision 3: Pre-Aggregated Metrics

What metrics should be stored directly in the fact table to avoid expensive joins?
- diagnosis_count? (how many diagnoses per encounter)
- procedure_count? (how many procedures per encounter)
- total_allowed? (sum of billing amounts)
- Others?

Justify why pre-aggregating these metrics helps performance.

#### Decision 4: Bridge Tables

Will you use bridge tables for many-to-many relationships (diagnoses-to-encounters, procedures-to-encounters)? Why or why not?

### 3.2: Build the Star Schema

Create complete DDL for your star schema in `star_schema.sql`:

- **Create all dimension tables:**
  - `dim_date` (with date_key, calendar_date, year, month, quarter, etc.)
  - `dim_patient` (with patient_key, patient_id, first_name, age_group, etc.)
  - `dim_provider` (with provider_key, provider_id, name, specialty, etc.)
  - `dim_specialty` (with specialty_key, specialty_id, specialty_name)
  - `dim_department` (with department_key, department_id, department_name)
  - `dim_encounter_type` (with encounter_type_key, type_name)

- **Create the fact table:**
  - `fact_encounters` (with all necessary foreign keys, pre-aggregated metrics, indexes)

- **Create any bridge tables needed for many-to-many relationships:**
  - `bridge_encounter_diagnoses` (if needed)
  - `bridge_encounter_procedures` (if needed)

- **Include:**
  - Primary keys (surrogate keys for dimensions)
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Appropriate indexes
  - Comments explaining each table's purpose

### 3.3: Translate Queries to Star Schema

Rewrite each of the 4 queries to use your new star schema. Document in `star_schema_queries.txt`:

For each query, show:
1. The SQL (optimized for star schema)
2. Execution time estimate (e.g., "~150ms vs. 1.8s original")
3. Improvement factor (e.g., "12x faster")
4. Explanation: Why is it faster? (fewer joins? pre-aggregated? denormalization? better indexes?)

### 3.4: ETL Logic

Document your ETL approach in `etl_design.txt`:

Write pseudocode or narrative describing:

1. **Dimension Load Logic**
   - How do you populate `dim_patient` from the `patients` table?
   - How do you populate `dim_date` (one-time load)?
   - How do you handle updates to dimensions?

2. **Fact Table Load Logic**
   - For each encounter, how do you look up dimension keys?
   - How do you calculate pre-aggregated metrics?
   - How do you handle missing data?

3. **Bridge Table Load Logic**
   - How do you populate `bridge_encounter_diagnoses`?
   - How do you populate `bridge_encounter_procedures`?

4. **Refresh Strategy**
   - How often would you load? (daily? incremental? full refresh?)
   - How would you handle late-arriving facts?

---

## Part 4: Analysis & Reflection

Write 1-2 pages in `reflection.md` addressing:

### 1. Why Is the Star Schema Faster?

Explain the performance difference:
- Compare # of JOINs in normalized vs. star schema
- Where is data pre-computed in the star schema?
- Why does denormalization help analytical queries?

### 2. Trade-offs: What Did You Gain? What Did You Lose?

Discuss the normalized vs. denormalized trade-off:
- What did you give up? (data duplication, ETL complexity)
- What did you gain? (faster queries, simpler analysis)
- Was it worth it?

### 3. Bridge Tables: Worth It?

Explain your decision:
- Why keep diagnoses/procedures in bridge tables instead of denormalizing into fact?
- What's the trade-off?
- Would you do it differently in production?

### 4. Performance Quantification

Show numbers for at least 2 queries:
- Original execution time: X seconds
- Optimized execution time: Y seconds
- Improvement: X/Y = ? times faster
- Main reason for the speedup
